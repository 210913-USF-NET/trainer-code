# Sample Proposal - Banking App 
 
## Overview  
The Banking App is a console-based application for managing your finances. You can log in, view your balance, withdraw money, and deposit money. You can also start a joint account with your friends or family so that everyone can add or remove money from the account, and a user can have multiple bank accounts. Additionally, bank managers can view account data and check the total value of their bank.
